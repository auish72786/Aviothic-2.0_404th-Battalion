Smart Medicine & Tracker is a web-based project developed by Ayush Pal as part of the Aviothic 2.0 Hackathon. This application helps users manage and track their daily medicines easily. It allows users to add details about their medicines, set reminders, and monitor their intake to ensure they never miss a dose. The project is designed with a simple and user-friendly interface that can be easily accessed through any device. It is especially helpful for elderly people and patients who need regular reminders for multiple medications. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project aims to promote better health management through technology. Future updates will include features like email or SMS notifications, login system, and cloud synchronization for storing user data securely.
